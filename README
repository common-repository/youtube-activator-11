Youtube Activator 1.0
========================


Based on the problematic, that no current tool on the market was able to cope with the simple task of chaning a videos status.

So what the plugin does, is to set a video to public, once its related wordpress post gets published.

Functionalities like this exist for Facebook, Twitter etc.

If you own a Podcast Blog and you do publish your Podcasts on Youtube, maybe this is an interesting Plugin if you would like 
to automate you publishing routine.


Technical Notes
===============

To faciliate best compatibility this plugin works by using the frequently tested and updated Zend_Gdata library.

If you have any problem with this plugin it would be wise to update this library, which resides in the same directory as the yt-activator.php
file.

The code for the plugin itself is very small and not really prone to errors, so any complications might likely occur due to changes on the Youtube API
